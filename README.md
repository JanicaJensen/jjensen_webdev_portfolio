## Janica's Developer Portfolio 

*This is a portfolio website that is meant to be updated as I learn more coding principles. The purpose is to showcase my work to potential employers.* 



## Setup 
That which is required to run the site is a browser and this URL: 


## Usage

The site features a title of the developer's name at the top, Janica Jensen. Directly beneath, one will find a navigation bar which includes links for "About", "Work", and "Contact". Clicking each of these will redirect the user to the part of the site that contains that information. It is a one-page application, therefore it will only auto-scroll the user to the indicated section. Note that there is a hover effect over all links "< a >"
 elements. 
 
 The first section is the "About", which includes a short description of myself and an Apple MeMoji portrait. 

 The second section is the "Work" section, which includes clickable images and text that will redirect the user to those apps. The featured app, Horiseon, is the largest. It is followed by three imaginary apps that I came up with while at a work meeting. The descriptions are silly and they are meant to be, please do not take them too seriously, they are not real. Clicking the Horiseon banner will indeed redirect you to that GitHub Pages site, while clicking the other 3 false apps will take you to a Canva site that I created purely to show that I can make the links work, since it was a part of the requriements. 
 
 The last section is the "Contact" section. This includes a form to contact the developer, a text-input box for the message, an email input box, and a send button. Please note that these will not do anything, unfortunately, we have not learned how to make those form inputs functional yet. They are there purely as dummy parts. There is also a link to my LinkedIn, which is real. Note that my name on LinkedIn is different than on the site, this is merely due to the fact that I am known with my maiden name at my current work and do not wish to update LinkedIn until I am officially no longer an employee with them.
